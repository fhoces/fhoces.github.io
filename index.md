# Open Policy Analysis  

## The good news 
There is a major push across scientific fields to increase the transparency and reproducibility (TR) of research. Guidelines and tools for reproducible and open research have been developed, and are been adopted by an ever growing number of academic organizations and individual researchers.

## The bad news 
At the same time in the domain of public policy, evidence seems be losing credibility. Different stakeholders, instead of weighting  the same evidence in accordance to different values, now disagree on what the evidence is, failing to reveal what their differing values are.

Across all evidence cited by different policy makers (example: reports from the Congressional Budget Office, agencies from the excecutive branch or think tanks) there is one common feature: **we don't know how the sausage is made!**. The obscurity behind the production of these policy analyses weakens their credibility, facilitating the cherry picking of reports. 

## Part of the solution
Let's follow science, open up the kitchen. And publish the cook book with the recipe. Many of the tools and protocols to increase transparency and reproducibility in science can be translated to increase TR in Policy Analysis. This would raise the credibility of policy reports and facilitate a more constructive debate in both the positivie and normative areas of public policy.
