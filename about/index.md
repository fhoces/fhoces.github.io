I am a PhD candidate in Policy Analysis at the Pardee RAND Graduate School. My work is about increasing the transparency and reproducibility of policy analysis as a way to strengthen the connection between policy and evidence.   Before RAND, I studied economics and worked in public policy doing impact evaluations and economic analysis of various social policies.
