I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS)](http://www.bitss.org/). I did my PhD in Policy Analysis at RAND with my dissertation focused on increasing the transparency and reproducibility of policy analysis as a way to strengthen the connection between policy and evidence. Before RAND, I studied economics and worked in public policy doing impact evaluations and economic analysis of various social policies.
